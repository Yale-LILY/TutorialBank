# split-md

NodeJS CLI that splits a Markdown file into smaller files based on a given delimiter. It's basically `str.split(pattern)` for `.md` files.

## Install

```
$ npm install split-md
```

## Useage

To use the CLI, type `split-md` followed by it's args:
* readPath (path to larger .md file)
* pattern (string)
* cleanName (string): do you want to remove anything from the pattern?
* writePath (path to where smaller files should be created)
* limit (optionally limit the number of files created)

#### Example

```
$ split-md 'tests/testdata.md' '### v' '###' '' 10
```

In the above example we are reading in `tests/testdata.md`. Our delimiter is whenever we see a line start with the pattern `### v`. We want to use this line for our new markdown file's name, however we want to remove the `###` by setting it as the cleanName variable. Lastly, we are setting the `writePath` to our current working directory by giving an empty string as the last variable. Also note that we are setting our limit to only create 10 files before exiting.
